### MiniProfiler for .NET (including ASP.NET & ASP.NET Core)

MiniProfiler for .NET now has a few flavors since .NET Core differs quite a bit from .NET Full Framework on the ASP.NET front. The pipelines have changed drastically (for the better), but that means how to configure MiniProfiler has also changed quite a bit.

- If you're using ASP.NET (*not* .NET Core), [**start here**]({{ site.baseurl }}/AspDotNet).
- If you're using ASP.NET Core, [**start here**]({{ site.baseurl }}/AspDotNetCore).

Once you're setup, see [**how to profile code**]({{ site.baseurl }}/HowTo/ProfileCode) to get some timings up and running.

#### Minimum requirements
MiniProfiler v4 runs on .NET 4.6 and above or .NET Standard 1.5 and above. .NET 4.6+ is required due to all of the `async` support added in v4. If you need to use a version earlier than .NET 4.6, MiniProfiler v3.x is for you.
