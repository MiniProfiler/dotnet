IMPORTANT

The "Async Targeting Pack for Visual Studio 11" (Microsoft.CompilerServices.AsyncTargetingPack) has been deprecated.
It has been replaced by the Microsoft.Bcl.Async NuGet package:

  https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bcl.Async

Since we aren't going to maintain and support Microsoft.CompilerServices.AsyncTargetingPack anymore, we encourage you
to migrate to Microsoft.Bcl.Async.

Thanks,
The .NET Framework Team
